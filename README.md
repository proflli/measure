# Measure

As an iOS developer, I always feel the lack of simple app to check position of objects/elements in any picture or screenshot. Now it's very easy to find position and size of any UI element, specifically x/y position and width/height/size.
 
 This app is specially designed for making Mobile Quality Assurance Engineer (QA Engg.) life much easier. Now they can quickly review Mobile UI with point & pixel perfect dimensions within minutes.
 
 HOW IT WORKS:
 Step1: Take Screenshot of the app to debug it. This will automatically be saved to your Camera Roll -> Screenshots album.
 Step2: Open Measure app and you can see your recent screenshot, enable ruler and straight line frame.
 Step3: Check your screenshot dimensions and UI element positions by zooming in/out and using rulers and line frame.
 
 Other fantastic features of Ruler app:
 - 4 Sided dynamic ruler. You can also adjust ruler position using your finger. Long tap for more options.
 - Free hand ruler scale. It can also rotate to check angles.
 - Straighten line frame.
 - Long tap & move on screenshot to show RGB color values of any position.
 - Multi-feature crop too.
 - Change Aspect Ratio.
 - Screenshot Resizing.
 - Change Device Scale Factor.
 - Double-Tap, Pan, pinch gestures to zoom and move pictures.
 
 Download to see how QA engineers accelerating their business by reducing time to check pixel measurements.
